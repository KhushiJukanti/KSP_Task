    <h1>Instagram: </h1><img src="instagram-1.png" alt="Image Description"><p>LLC[6][a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location — via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.</p>
    <h2>History</h2><p>Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $615,400 in 2021) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[9][10] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users.[11][12] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of "instant camera" and "telegram".[13]</p>
    <h3>Features and Tools</h3><p>Users can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds,[119] and geotag images with the name of a location.[120] Users can set their account as "private", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests.[121] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites.[122] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon.[123][124] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well.[125][126][127] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.[128][129]

        Since December 2016, posts can be "saved" into a private area of the app.[130][131] The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections.[132][133] Users can also "archive" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of "likes" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the "emergent behavior" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.[134][135] In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies.[136][137]
        
        Since February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel.[138][139] The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead.[140][141]
        
        In April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called "focus mode," which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.[142] In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.[143]
        
        On March 1, 2021, Instagram launched a new feature named Instagram Live "Rooms" Let Four People Go Live Together.[144]
        
        In May 2021, Instagram announced a new accessibility feature for videos on Instagram Reels and Stories to allow creators to place closed captions on their content.</p>
    <h4>HashTags</h4><P>In January 2011, Instagram introduced <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">hashtags</a> to help users discover both photos and each other.[146][147] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like "photo", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.[148]

        Users on Instagram have created "trends" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.[149][150]
        
        In December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.</P>
    <h5>Photographic Filters</h5><p>Instagram offers a number of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_filter"> <i>photographic  filters</i></a> that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a "Lux" filter, an effect that "lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast".[163][164] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.</p>
    <h6><b>Video</b></h6><p><b>Initially</b><u>a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013.</u> [166][167] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine.[168][169] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos.[170][171] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds.[172][173] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.</p>
